# Suggestions/Corrections


## Ch. 1

- 1.4 end: Suggestion: introduce notation for median - and make the remark regarding the notation of the mean ($\mu$ vs $\overline{x}$) more prominent.
- 1.5: Suggestion: introduce box-and-whiskers plot (using 1.5 IQR rule for the whiskers and outliers)

## Ch. 3

- Suggestion: Section 3.2:  add note about shortcut convention for probabilities of individual outcomes $P(\{5\})=P(5)$.
- after Ex. 3.25, p. 40: use double-arrows for \biimp instead of single arrows?

- Suggestion for Additivity Axiom:  Introduce the symbol for a _disjoint_ union: $\cupdot$ (my favourite) or $\sqcup$.

- Suggestion for end of Ch. 3: State Bayes' Rule and give an example.

- Suggestion:  Add a remark that in many situations we can directly determine a conditional probability from the context, rather than using the definition to find it. In that case, the intersection formula can be used as a consequence.

- Suggestion:  Add a remark that we often can _assume_ independence, for example for physically separate procedures.

- Suggestion: add explanation that independence of two dice rolls is the actual reason why we _must_ use order when noting the two results.

## Ch. 4

- 4.3: add a remark that the Variance is _not_ the same as the Bessel corrected variance for a sample (in contrast to the remark in 4.2), even for a uniform distribution.

- 4.8: replace the example graphs by one picture with several different Gaussians, to show the effect of mean and variance.

- The notation for a Gaussian distribution is never properly defined, even though it is already used in the example graphs (Gaussian(0,1) and Gaussian(25,3)) is used without explanation.

- "Normal":  The comment about the alternative (and still widely used) name "Normal distribution" should be made more prominently, e.g. in a remark.

- should include a standard z-table in the back matter (matching the precision used in the text, i.e. 4 significant digits for now)
- mention software/apps to use as an alternative?

- 4.10, p. 71f: clarify that the shown histograms are only approximations of the true sampling distribution (it's mentioned at the beginning, but it could/should maybe be made more prominent). Maybe replace the graph title "Distribution" by "approximate Distr."?

- p. 77 bottom: right away use z=1.96 instead of z=2 (maybe also clarify Prop. 4.8 about this) - since you're using the more precise value on p. 79 (Ex. 5.2) anyways.


## Ch. 5

- p. 82 top: The explanation should be kept together with the plot (possibly as a \caption) - and maybe add a legend directly in the plot, showing the different values of $n$.

- p. 81/82: add a note that "Student" is William Sealy Gosset's pen name.

- p. 81 and following (especially Prop. 5.2): There is significant mixing (sometimes inconsistent) of upper vs lowercase notation for $\bar{x}$ and $s$, without explanation.  This should be clarified somewhere. 

- p. 84 bottom: "the easiest way for students" - maybe remove the "for students" to make it a more neutral statement?

- p. 88 top: replace "one hundred and one" by "101" and add a note "(including the possibility of no successes)"


## General suggestions / discussion points for the future:

- Discuss: move & teach combinatorics _after_ Ch. 3 (especially after having introduced independence), to reinforce the fact that equal likelihood of outcomes (and hence the classical prob. model) is _not_ the norm?  (I've had way too many students still default to assuming the classical model when it didn't apply, despite many warnings...)

- Randomized Trials: We have them listed on the GCO, but they are not mentioned in the ministry competencies - and they're not covered in the notes for now. Should we just remove them from the GCO?
